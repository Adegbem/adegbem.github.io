Hello! Interestingly, I got introduced to programming in my second year at [FUTA](https://www.futa.edu.ng/) where I completed my Bachelors in Applied Physics (2009-2014).

I have since then pursue my interest in programing from basic Language such as Java and Python. I diversify into the world of data during my Postgraduate research program. I actual dive and enrol into a Data Science academy [Explore AI](https://www.explore.ai
) (Jan 2022-Octorber 2022) witha a three month intership.

I am now a Data scientist with 3-year experience in python base project, and freelance jobs. Highly analytical with a strong apt for
learning, teaching and collaborations. Ready to use my skill and work-ready expertise in programming, statistical analysis, research abilities, and machine learning algorithms. 

I'm currently working as a Data science freelancer and a part-time lecturer for **Federal Polytechnic Ede** in the Physics Department. My responsibilty includes Developing core curriculum, teaching and mentoring First year student.

Here is a list of the technologies that I'm familiar with!
